                    describing own self, one has to take care of lots of things. <br> There are many ways to describe
                    oneself, but one of the most important ways is to think about what makes you unique. What are the
                    qualities that make you stand out from the rest? <br> What are your strengths and weaknesses? What are
                    my passions and interests? My name is Prince upadhyay. i read in class 11. i gave my see examination in
                    my school. my father name is nabraj upadhyay. my mother name is sunita upadhyay. <br> i live in
